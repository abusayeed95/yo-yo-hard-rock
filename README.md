# Project: Yo Yo Hard Rock

This project was very fun project. When I just learned to *API* I got chance to finish this project. In this project I have used an free api from unknown source and *HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap*. In this site you can search your desired song name. Then you will find some songs. After clicking show lyrics you'll see lyrics of the song. If your desired song doesn't have any lyrics then you'll be notified.
